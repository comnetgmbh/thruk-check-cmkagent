NAME

    thruk-check_cmkagent

    The 'Check_CMKAgent' plugin allows automatically configuring Check_MK
    agent-based services.

DESCRIPTION

    thruk-check-cmkagent allows you to easily generate Nagios-compatible
    configuration files from check_cmkagent_active Check_MK agent dumps.

INSTALLATION

    Just copy the files in this directory to your Thruk plugins-available
    directory and enable thruk-check-cmkagent.

USAGE

 GENERAL

    You can get an overview of every discovered host in check_cmkagent.cgi.
    Please note that you'll need to run check_cmkagent_active[1] for every
    host you want to manage here. To make things easier, you can use the
    cmkagent-host host template. This will add an check_cmkagent action
    icon to your host, allowing you to quickly skip to your host in
    check_cmkagent.

 GENERATING RULES

    Open check_cmkagent.cgi

    Select the host and service you wish to monitor

    Modify the warning and critical thresholds to suit your needs

      Note: In general, these are percentages given in the range from 0 to
      100. This is NOT always the case; please refer to
      check_cmkagent_local's documentation for details on this.

    Click generate. Your monitoring core will be reloaded automatically to
    apply your new configuration.
